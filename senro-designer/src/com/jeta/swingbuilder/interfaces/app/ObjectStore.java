 *  This interface describes a service used to store/retrive objects

 *  this to store information such as user properties between
 *  program invocations.  The keyName is unique, so only one object
 *  per keyname.  Of course, a single object can be composed of many
 *  subobjects.  Serialization is used as the storage mechanism, so
 *  the objects must be serializable.
