/**
 * A <code>DynamicPropertyDescriptor</code> is similar to a standard Java Beans
 * PropertyDescriptor. However, these descriptors can be dynamically added and removed.
 * For example, some Swing components such as JTables and JLists are almost always
 * contained within a JScrollPane.  So, instead of working with a JScrollPane, we add
 * a scrollable property to the Swing components instead. This scrollable property is
 * an example of a dynamic property since it is not defined by the Java Bean.
 * Dynamic properties are defined by a <code>DynamicPropertyDescriptor</code> and are
 * assigned to a bean using <code>BeanFactory</code> instances.
