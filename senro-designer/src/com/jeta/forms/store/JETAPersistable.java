/**
 * Defines an interface that all persitable objects in the forms designer
 * must implement.  It is similar to Exernalizable except that it adds
 * read/write methods that take JETAObjectInput and JETAObjectOutput.  This
 * is needed so that our 'Serializable' objects can be stored using an
 * arbitrary persistence scheme.  Currently, we support standard Java Serialization
 * and XML.  Using this approach, it would be easy to added support for any other
 * type of format.
