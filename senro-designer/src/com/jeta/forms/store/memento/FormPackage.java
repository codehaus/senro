 * This class is used to wrap a Form when it is stored to a file. When you

 * some information to the file at a later date that is outside the scope of the
 * FormMemento. Only one FormPackage object is used per file. [FormPackage]
 * [forms version] [FormMemento] ----- the main form [FormMemento] ---- a nested
