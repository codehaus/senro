/**
 * The UI for a  component that simulates the bottom of a TitledBorder.  This component is
 * useful when flattening layouts.  It allows a titled border to be used to separate components,
 * while allowing those components to stay in the same row or column of the form.  This
 * allows components to have the same x,y, width, or height, yet have differnt title borders.
 * This is not possible when using standard TitledBorder.
