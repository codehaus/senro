/**
 * This class acts as a front end to a FormUndoableEdit.
 * It behaves in exactly the same way as the delegate
 * however, we add the concept of a locked state.  Since
 * we share edit objects between opened editors, we
 * can put the locked flag in the delegate.
 *
 * We need to lock an edit when we are editing a form in
 * two different editors. This can happen if the form is nested.
 * If the undo managers for the editors get out of sync (which can easily happen)
 * then we need to lock the edits that are out of sync.
