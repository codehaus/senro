/**
 * A component finder that is composed of multipe component finders.
 * This is very useful for Frames that contain multiple containers with
 * components that have the same command.  For example, you might
 * have a menu item, toolbar button, and popup menu item that have the
 * same cut, copy, and paste commands.  These commands should route 
 * to the same action listener in the controller. To handle this case, 
 * use a CompositeComponentFinder which is composed of a finder for the 
 * menu, toolbar, and popup. You can then define your Frame as a JETAContainer 
 * and delegate the most of the JETAContainer methods to this finder.
