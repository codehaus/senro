/**
 * An interface that defines the attributes of a CellConstraints
 * object in a FormLayout.  This interface is needed because we
 * want to decouple the our architecture from the knowledge needed
 * to get the CellConstraints from the FormLayout. This has the added
 * benefit of allowing us to create Proxy objects which can improve
 * performance because the FormLayout always returns copies rather than
 * the actual CellConstraints.  This causes significant delays
 * during repaints.
